# pLiner
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/278142654.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/278142654)

**pLiner** is a framework that helps programmers identify locations in the source of numerical code that are highly affected by floating-point compiler optimizations.  

Compiler optimizations can alter significantly the numerical results of scientific computing applications. When numerical results differ significantly between compilers, optimization levels, and floating-point hardware, these numerical inconsistencies can impact programming productivity. **pLiner** is a framework that helps programmers identify locations in the source code that are highly affected by compiler optimizations. **pLiner** uses a novel approach to identify such code locations by enhancing the floating-point precision of variables and expressions. Using a guided search to locate the most significant code regions, **pLiner** can report to users such locations at different granularities, file, function, and line of code. **pLiner** is implemented as a clang tool. Currently **pLiner** only supports C/C++.

# Getting Started

## Requirements and Setup  
There are 4 options to start using pLiner:
1. Download the docker image from DockerHub and run the container
2. Building the docker image through dockerfile and running the container
3. Building pLiner as a standalone tool
4. Building pLiner in the source tree of clang/LLVM

### Requirements to run pLiner as a docker container
- Docker client needs to be installed in the host machine before starting to setup pLiner using option 1 and 2.

#### Option 1: Download the docker image from DockerHub and run the container.  
  1. Download the docker image from DockerHub:
  ```
  docker pull ucdavisplse/llnl_pliner:latest
  ```
  2. Run the docker container
  ```
  docker run -it ucdavisplse/llnl_pliner:latest /bin/bash
  ```
  
#### Option 2: Building the docker image through dockerfile and running the container

  1. Clone the pLiner github repo
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/llnl/pLiner.git
  ```
  2. Building the docker image from dockerfile:
  ```
  cd pLiner
  docker build -t <tag-name> .
  ```
  2. Run the docker container
  ```
  docker run -it <tag-name> /bin/bash
  ```

### Requirements to use pLiner through manual setup(Option3 or Option 4).
- Installing clang/LLVM compiler is a prerequisite to use pLiner. So far, we have tested pLiner on clang/LLVM 9.0.1. 
- pLiner uses [nlohmann::json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) to parse json files in C/C++. Download file `json.hpp` from [https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/develop/single_include/nlohmann/json.hpp](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/develop/single_include/nlohmann/json.hpp) (version 3.5.0) and place it in the directory `pLiner/clang-tool` before using pLiner.
  
#### Option 3: building pLiner as a standalone tool  
  1. Clone pLiner and build it:  
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/llnl/pLiner.git
  cd pLiner/clang-tool
  mkdir build; cd build
  cmake ..
  make
  ```
  2. Install pLiner
  ```
  make install
  ``` 
  Or, export path to pLiner (this command may differ depending on shell):
  ```
  export PATH=$PATH-TO-pLiner/clang-tool/build:$PATH
  ```
  #### Option 4: building pLiner in the source tree of clang/LLVM  
  1. Building clang/LLVM 9.0.1:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git clang-llvm
  git checkout llvmorg-9.0.1
  cd ~/clang-llvm
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake -G Ninja ../llvm -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="clang;clang-tools-extra" -DLLVM_BUILD_TESTS=ON
  ninja
  ninja check       # Test LLVM only.
  ninja clang-test  # Test Clang only.
  ninja install
  ```

  Note: Refer to https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LibASTMatchersTutorial.html in case you need instructions for installing `cmake` and/or `ninja`.
  
  2. Clone pLiner in the clang-tools-extra directory and build it:
  ```
  cd ../clang-tools-extra
  git clone https://github.com/llnl/pLiner.git
  echo "add_subdirectory(pLiner/clang-tool)" >> CMakeLists.txt
  cp pLiner/clang-tool/CMakeLists.txt-insource pLiner/CMakeLists.txt
  cd ../build
  ninja
  ```
  3. Export path to pLiner (this command may differ depending on shell):
  ```
  export PATH=$PATH-TO-CLANG-LLVM/build/bin:$PATH
  ```


### Run optional unit tests
  ```
  cd pLiner/tests
  ./test.sh
  ```
  If pliner works as expected, all unit tests would pass.

## Running pLiner

### Running pLiner on a test program

We use a simple C program `vtest.c` to show how to use pLiner. This program was generated by a floating-point random program generator, [Varity](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1581779-varit), and it produces inconsistent results when compiled with `gcc -O3 -ffast-math` compared to `gcc -O0`. pLiner isolated a line of the code in the source (Line 25) as the origin of the compiler-induced inconsistency. pLiner also provided a transformed version of the program `vtest_trans.c`, in which the isolated line of the code has been transformed to higher precision, and the transformed program produces consistent results between `gcc -O3 -ffast-math` and `gcc -O0`.

  1. Change to the `example` directory:
  ```
  cd pLiner/example
  ```
  
  2. Compile the original `vtest.c` program with both `gcc -O3 -ffast-math` and `gcc -O0`, and compare the results:
  ```
  make
  ./cmp.sh vtest
  ```
   
  `vtest_O0` corresponds to the executable generated by compiling `vtest.c` with `gcc -O0`, and `vtest_O3` corresponds to the executable generated by compiling `vtest.c` with `gcc -O3 -ffast-math`.  
   
 The expected output when comparing the results should be:
 
 ```
 ./vtest_O0 +1.8768E-306 5 -1.3896E-307 +1.2460E-307 -1.4722E306 -0.0 -1.7470E-322 +1.7072E-307 -1.9009E-307 +1.6022E137 +1.3969E306 +1.8813E34 -1.9422E-99 -1.2666E305 +0.0 -1.2316E-314 +1.5805E-323 +1.7072E208 +1.9220E-307 +1.6811E-306
1.7071999999999999e+208
./vtest_O3 +1.8768E-306 5 -1.3896E-307 +1.2460E-307 -1.4722E306 -0.0 -1.7470E-322 +1.7072E-307 -1.9009E-307 +1.6022E137 +1.3969E306 +1.8813E34 -1.9422E-99 -1.2666E305 +0.0 -1.2316E-314 +1.5805E-323 +1.7072E208 +1.9220E-307 +1.6811E-306
-1.8508999968058596e-316
 ```
 
 Note that the difference between `vtest_O0` and `vtest_O3` is very large. We will use pLiner to diagnose the root cause of the numerical difference.  

  3. Run pLiner:
  ```
  python ../scripts/search.py vtest.c "--"
  ```
  
  The first argument `vtest.c` is the input program; the second argument `"--"` indicates that to compile the input program there are no header files/librares to specify in the compilation command. Additionally, if there are any such compilation options such as "-I $PATH-TO-HEADERS", specify them following "--" in the second argument, e.g., "-- -I $PATH-TO-HEADERS". Use `--help` to check for the details of the arguments.

  Following is the output.
  ```
  ...
  The following areas are transformed to high precision:
compute :
   20 -> 22
   23 -> 23
failed
The following areas are transformed to high precision:
compute :
   25 -> 25
   26 -> 26
   28 -> 28
success
The following areas are transformed to high precision:
compute :
   25 -> 25
success
Search for lines:
The following areas are transformed to high precision:
compute :
   25 -> 25
success


 Bug area:
compute :
  line  25

  ```


   * pLiner found the root cause of the inconsistency (function `compute`, line 25):  
    ` compute :`  
    `    line 25`    

   * pLiner generated a transformed program `vtest_trans.c`.
   ```
   ls *.c
   vtest.c vtest_trans.c
   ```
   
   4. Compile the transformed `vtest_trans.c` program with both `gcc -O3 -ffast-math` and `gcc -O0`, and compare the results:
   ```
   make
   ./cmp.sh vtest_trans
   ```
The expected output when comparing the results should be:
```
./vtest_trans_O0 +1.8768E-306 5 -1.3896E-307 +1.2460E-307 -1.4722E306 -0.0 -1.7470E-322 +1.7072E-307 -1.9009E-307 +1.6022E137 +1.3969E306 +1.8813E34 -1.9422E-99 -1.2666E305 +0.0 -1.2316E-314 +1.5805E-323 +1.7072E208 +1.9220E-307 +1.6811E-306
1.7071999999999999e+208
./vtest_trans_O3 +1.8768E-306 5 -1.3896E-307 +1.2460E-307 -1.4722E306 -0.0 -1.7470E-322 +1.7072E-307 -1.9009E-307 +1.6022E137 +1.3969E306 +1.8813E34 -1.9422E-99 -1.2666E305 +0.0 -1.2316E-314 +1.5805E-323 +1.7072E208 +1.9220E-307 +1.6811E-306
1.7071999999999999e+208
```

Both `vtest_trans_O0` and `vtest_trans_O3` produce `1.7071999999999999e+208`. The results are consistent with `vtest_O0`.

Please refer to results inside SP.A folder for the updated results.

## Use pLiner for your programs

You can follow the instructions as shown in the example to run pLiner for your own programs. Specifically, 

* Specify the compiler, compilation options that induce inconsistent results, and an error threshold in `run.sh`  
 In the example above, those are specified in `run.sh` as
 ```
 CC="/usr/bin/gcc"
 CFLAGS=" -O0 -g -std=c99"
 CFLAGS_trouble=" -O3 -ffast-math -g -std=c99"
 THRESHOLD=8 
 ```
 `CC` specifies the compiler; `CFLAGS` specifies the compilation options that are used to produce ground-truth results and `CFLAGS_trouble` specifies the compilation options that induce inconsistent results; lastly, `THRESHOLD` specifies the number of digits that are required to be same with the ground truth for consistency check.
 
* Specify your program file in the first argument, and the compilation options needed to compile the program in the second argument such as 
`python pLiner/scripts/search.py vtest.c "--"` in the example.
